abstract = {Underwater images typically exhibit color distortion and low contrast as a result of the exponential decay that light suffers as it travels. Moreover, colors associated to different wavelengths have different attenuation rates, being the red wavelength the one that attenuates the fastest. To restore underwater images, we propose a Red Channel method, where colors associated to short wavelengths are recovered, as expected for underwater images, leading to a recovery of the lost contrast. The Red Channel method can be interpreted as a variant of the Dark Channel method used for images degraded by the atmosphere when exposed to haze. Experimental results show that our technique handles gracefully artificially illuminated areas, and achieves a natural color correction and superior or equivalent visibility improvement when compared to other state-of-the-art methods.}

abstract = {Images captured under water are often characterized by low contrast, color distortion, and noise, hindering some visual tasks carried out on it. Despite remarkable breakthrough has been made in recent years, effective and robust enhancement of degraded image remains a challenging problem. To improve the quality of underwater images, we propose a novel scheme by constructing an adaptive color and contrast enhancement, and denoising (ACCE-D) framework. In the proposed framework, Difference of Gaussian (DoG) filter and bilateral filter are respectively employed to decompose the high-frequency and low-frequency components. Benefited from this separation, we utilize soft-thresholding operation to suppress the noise in the high-frequency component. Specially, the low-frequency component is enhanced by using an adaptive color and contrast enhancement (ACCE) strategy. Moreover, we derive a numerical solution for ACCE, and adopt a pyramid-based strategy to accelerate the solving procedure. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our strategy is effective in color correction, contrast enhancement, and detail revealing. In the quantitative evaluations, by performing on the 890 real-world underwater images from UIEBD, the proposed method obtains 0.65 UCIQE, 1.59 UIQM, 0.81 FDUM, 1.34 PCQI, 0.62 CBPD, and 7.75 entropy scores, achieving average increase of 5% comparing with several state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we have verified the utility of our proposed ACCE-D for enhancing other types of degraded scenes, including foggy scene, sandstorm scene and low-light scene.}

abstract = {In Sparse Coding (SC), input vectors are reconstructed using a sparse linear combination of basis vectors. SC has become a popular method for extracting features from data. For a given input, SC minimizes a quadratic reconstruction error with an L1 penalty term on the code. The process is often too slow for applications such as real-time pattern recognition. We proposed two versions of a very fast algorithm that produces approximate estimates of the sparse code that can be used to compute good visual features, or to initialize exact iterative algorithms. The main idea is to train a non-linear, feed-forward predictor with a specific architecture and a fixed depth to produce the best possible approximation of the sparse code. A version of the method, which can be seen as a trainable version of Li and Osher's coordinate descent method, is shown to produce approximate solutions with 10 times less computation than Li and Os-her's for the same approximation error. Unlike previous proposals for sparse code predictors, the system allows a kind of approximate "explaining away" to take place during inference. The resulting predictor is differentiable and can be included into globally-trained recognition systems.},
